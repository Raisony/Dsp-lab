\b read_wavefile_01.m
\b0 \
\
In Matlab, reads 'cat' wav file.\
Play signal, plot signal, illustrate quantization, FFT and plot.\
Illustrates fftshift, FFT zero-padding\
\

\b read_wavefile_02.py\
read_wavefile_03.py\

\b0 \
Open a wav file in python and read information.\
\

\b write_sin_01.py\

\b0 \
How many bits per sample ?\
How many bits per second ?\
What if maxAmp is higher than the value used in the demo? Or lower?\
For stereo, how many bits per second are there?\
What if 'h' is a different code ?\
What if there are more than two channels?\
\

\b read_sin_01.m\

\b0 \
Plot the spectrum of the sinusoid. The peak in the spectrum better match the frequency of the sinusoid!\
\

\b write_sin_02.py
\b0 \
\
Use python to generate a wav file with more bits per sample.\
Verify that the spectrum has a peak at the prescribed frequency.\
Verify that that the number of bits per sample is the prescribed value.\
\

\b Activities for students (see assignment)
\b0 \
\
Use Matlab to read in sin_02_mono.wav\
- Verify quantization size, is it as expected?\
Solution: read_sin_02.m\
\
Use Python to generate a WAV file of a sine wave at 8 bits per sample. (How do you do this?)\
Solution: write_sin_03.py\
\
Read your 8 bit/sample wav file into matlab\
- verify quantization is as expected, verify spectrum,\
- Is there any audible affect of the lower number of bits/second?\
Solution: read_sin_03.m\
	\
Use Python to create a wave file of a sinusoid with a lower frequency, like 50 Hz.\
How low can the frequency be before you can not hear it?\
Solution: write_sin_04.py\
\
Use python to create a wav file with more than two channels.  Read the wave file into Matlab and plot the individual channels.\
Solution: write_sin_05.py, read_sin_05.m \
	\
In a stereo wave file, how are the two channels of a stereo audio signal stored?  \
\
Use Python to create a wave file of a sinusoid using a higher sampling rate, like 16K 32K or 441,000 samples/second.\
